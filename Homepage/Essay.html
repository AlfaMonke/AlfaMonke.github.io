                At the top of 94th street in Brooklyn, New York, there lies a subway station that calls itself the 95th street stop. I remember walking out of that subway stop day after day, school day after school day. That subway stop was my portal into the freedom of the city, and my exit to the calm-ness of 94th street. The entire city would be open to me for only $2.75. However, wherever I went, I would always return to that subway stop, my gateway into the rest of 94th street.

                Walking out of the station, I would always pass by a library known as the Fort Hamilton Public Library. A library where I would go to spend time with friends, where I would work on my homework at the crowded dark-wood tables when my house was full and I didn’t feel like socializing. That library was the one where the absence of light around the sides would ironically illuminate the center of the floor where the computers were housed, like the computers are what people primarily go to the library for. The library where kids who spent too much time procrastinating on those computers would learn that procrastination only postpones the inevitable, and the library where disruptive kids would learn the consequences for their actions, finding out that it would probably be for the best to not make the same mistake again.

                I remember a time when I was browsing the graphic novel selection of the library when a group of 3 middle school boys began to disturb people in the bathroom as a joke by hitting the bathroom door as hard as their giddy arms could while screaming something about being the police and needing to search them and the bathroom. The victims were sure to report the disturbance and the kids were promptly thrown out of the library by the security guard, but  no greater punishment was levied against them. However even without a phone call home to their parents, those kids have yet to attempt anything like that prank to this day. And hopefully it will stay that way lest the victims of the prank’s sacrifice would be in vain.

                After walking by the library, I would turn down the block, home in sight and in reach. I remember how there was an old man who sat just out of his front door who would often ask a simple question to any passerby such as “How’s your day going?” as well as talking to neighbors he knew for longer periods of time, including my father, which is why he knew me. I would see my father talking to the man like they were the oldest of friends even though they would only ever exchange a few statements every day or so. Because of this, as I would pass him on a daily basis I would try to act like my father in terms of social ability. Sometimes making small talk, sometimes passing off a laugh or a chuckle as my statement in response. While I may not have been the best at it, I do still think it helped me get over at least a little of my sheepishness.

            <p5>
                On days where the old man wasn’t on his doorstep, even with my exhaustion that had built up throughout the long day of school, I would still often find the strength to sprint down the block in order to reach the safety and security of my own home. There I would be at the mercy of my parents and what they wanted from me, however this would and still never bothers me. Though not knowing it at the time, I did this because even with the bliss that comes from a subway stop, $2.75, and the freedom of the open city, sometimes what you need is your parents to pull you out and save you from the independence that you aren’t ready for. Because when the train stops, when it gets to the point where you need an out, you may not be ready or even capable of getting out at the next stop yourself.
